# SINAIS Circles - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Authentication & Profile Management ✅

**Created:**
- [`services/UserContext.ts`](../services/UserContext.ts) - User profile management service
  - Fetches user data from Supabase
  - Stores current user context
  - Provides display name fallback logic

**Updated:**
- [`screens/LoginScreen.tsx`](../screens/LoginScreen.tsx:229) - Fetches user profile after login
- [`screens/HomeScreen.tsx`](../screens/HomeScreen.tsx:49) - Shows logged-in user's name
- [`screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`](../screens/ProfileScreen.tsx:200) - Displays actual user data

### 2. SINAIS Circles Full Implementation ✅

**Created:**
- [`services/CirclesService.ts`](../services/CirclesService.ts) - Complete circles management
  - `getUserCircles()` - Fetch user's circles from database
  - `getCircleMembers()` - Get members with profiles
  - `createCircle()` - Create new accountability circles
  - `inviteMember()` - Invite users by email
  - `acceptInvitation()` - Accept circle invitations
  - `leaveCircle()` - Leave a circle
  - `updateTransparency()` - Control privacy levels

**Updated:**
- [`screens/CirclesScreen.tsx`](../screens/CirclesScreen.tsx) - Fully functional UI
  - Real-time data loading from Supabase
  - Create circles with descriptions
  - View circle members with wellness scores
  - Invite members by email
  - Loading states and error handling

### 3. Onboarding Flow Fix ✅

**Updated:**
- [`screens/QuizScreen.tsx`](../screens/QuizScreen.tsx:110) - Navigate to MainTabs instead of FaceRegistration
- Face registration is now **optional** and accessible from Profile screen

### 4. Database Integration ✅

All services now connect to Supabase:
- User profiles table
- Accountability circles table
- Circle members table with RLS policies
